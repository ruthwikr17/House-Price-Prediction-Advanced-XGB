# 🏡 House Price Prediction: XGB-Powered Predictive Analytics for Indian Housing Markets
House Price Prediction using Advanced XGBoost Techniques 


This project presents a robust machine learning system designed to predict residential property prices across Indian cities using advanced ensemble models including XGBoost, Random Forest, and CatBoost. The system is supported by a fully interactive Streamlit dashboard, offering users real-time prediction, filtering, and AI-assisted search capabilities.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Accurately estimating house prices is challenging due to diverse factors like location, area, number of rooms, property type, and city-specific trends. Buyers and real estate professionals require reliable tools to support informed decisions in this complex market.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

- A data-driven regression system using ensemble ML models.
- Real-time predictions with dynamic user input.
- AI-powered natural language search interface (via Gemini API).
- Support for city-specific price ranges and outlier filtering.

---

## 🔍 Dataset

- **Source:** Curated Indian real estate dataset.
- **Key Features:**
  - Location, City, Property Type
  - Total Area (SQFT), Total Rooms, BHK, Balcony
  - Target: Price (in INR)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **CatBoost Regressor**
- **Stacking Ensemble** (Final Model)

> Target variable is log-transformed to handle skewed distribution. City-wise price ranges are used to clamp outliers.
